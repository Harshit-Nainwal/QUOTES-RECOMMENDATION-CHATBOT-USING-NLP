# 🤖 Quotes Recommendation Chatbot using NLP

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Quotes Recommendation Chatbot** is an AI-powered conversational system designed to recommend motivational, inspirational, love, funny, and success quotes based on user input.

The chatbot uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** through the **Rasa framework** to understand user queries and provide appropriate responses. A **Flask-based web interface** enables users to interact with the chatbot through a browser instead of the command-line interface.

This project demonstrates how NLP-based conversational agents can be integrated with a modern web interface to create an interactive and user-friendly chatbot system.
